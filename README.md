This application is open source and Licensed under the WTFPL. That said I hope you keep the application as a kids application.

I am writing the application because I searched GooglePlay and Amazon for FREE games that would teach them, and all I found 
were "free" games.  In app purchases, and add sponsored.  I just wanted something they could use to help them in their 
upcomming school year.  Surly there's some dad or mom out there with the skill to write an app and just give it away.  

It seemed after several hours of searching that I came up with a pile of partial apps.  My kids were happy, but not really challenged.
The hard parts of the game came later, after I got the expansion packs.  

The application is a part time thing for me.. I write it while I watch TV.  I am not an Android programmer by trade, and Java is not my 
primary language.  

If you have any requests for the application, please post an issue here, and I'll see if my kids think it's a good idea.  Or by all means fork this repo.
