===================

This application is open source and Licensed under the WTFPL. That said I hope you keep the application as a kids application.

I am writing the application because I searched GooglePlay and Amazon for FREE games that would teach my kids, and all I found 
were "free" games.  In app purchases, and add sponsored.  I just wanted something they could use to help them in their 
upcomming school year.  Surly there's some dad or mom out there with the skill to write an app and just give it away.  

-- I should mention that I have paid for games for my kids.  They love DragonBox (as do I). It and several others were well worth the tuppance.  It irks me though when something says FREE and it isn't.  

The application is a part time thing for me.. I write it while I watch TV.  I am not an Android programmer by trade, and Java is not my 
primary language.  

If you have any requests for the application, please post an issue here, and I'll see if my kids think it's a good idea.  Or by all means fork this repo.
